# Upload Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### üî¥ **Critical Issue: Missing Environment Variables**
Your `.env.local` file is missing essential environment variables:
- ‚ùå `UPLOADTHING_TOKEN` - Required for file uploads
- ‚ùå `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Required for PDF summarization
- ‚ùå `DATABASE_URL` - Required for saving summaries

**Action Required:** Add these to your `.env.local` file (see `.env.example` for template)

### ‚úÖ **Code Improvements Made**

#### 1. Enhanced Error Handling (`UploadPDFForm.tsx`)
- Added comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Validates `serverData` exists in upload response
- Better error messages for debugging
- Proper cleanup on errors

#### 2. Improved Server Actions (`uploadActions.ts`)
- Added validation for all response data
- Better null/undefined checks
- Consistent return types with `success`, `message`, `data`
- Detailed error messages at each step

#### 3. Data Flow Validation
- Validates upload response structure
- Checks for serverData before processing
- Verifies PDF text extraction succeeded
- Confirms summary generation completed
- Validates database save operation

## Required Setup Steps

### Step 1: Add Missing Environment Variables

Edit `.env.local` and add these variables:

```env
# UploadThing - Get from https://uploadthing.com/dashboard
UPLOADTHING_TOKEN=your_token_here

# Google Gemini AI - Get from https://ai.google.dev/
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Database URL (if not already set)
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
```

### Step 2: Verify Database Setup

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Run migrations if needed
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Check database connection
npx prisma studio
```

### Step 3: Restart Development Server

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart
npm run dev
```

## How to Get Required API Keys

### UploadThing Token
1. Visit https://uploadthing.com/
2. Sign up or log in
3. Create a new app
4. Copy the token from dashboard

### Gemini API Key
1. Visit https://ai.google.dev/
2. Sign in with Google account
3. Go to "Get API Key"
4. Create new key or use existing one

### Database URL
If using local PostgreSQL:
```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/conciseai"
```

If using cloud provider (Vercel, Supabase, etc.), copy the connection string from their dashboard.

## Testing the Upload

Once environment variables are set:

1. **Restart the dev server**
2. **Navigate to** `/upload`
3. **Select a PDF file** (start with small file < 5MB)
4. **Click "Upload your PDF"**
5. **Watch console logs** for detailed debugging info

### Expected Flow
1. ‚úÖ File validation
2. ‚úÖ Upload to UploadThing
3. ‚úÖ Extract PDF text
4. ‚úÖ Generate summary with Gemini AI
5. ‚úÖ Save to database
6. ‚úÖ Redirect to summary page

### Common Errors and Solutions

| Error Message | Cause | Solution |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| "Upload failed" | Missing UPLOADTHING_TOKEN | Add token to .env.local |
| "Failed to generate summary" | Missing GEMINI_API_KEY | Add API key to .env.local |
| "Failed to save" | Database connection issue | Check DATABASE_URL |
| "Unauthorized" | Not logged in | Sign in with Clerk |
| "No serverData" | UploadThing config issue | Check app/api/uploadthing/core.ts |

## Debug Checklist

- [ ] All environment variables set in `.env.local`
- [ ] Development server restarted after adding env vars
- [ ] Logged in with Clerk authentication
- [ ] Database connection working (`npx prisma studio`)
- [ ] UploadThing account active
- [ ] Gemini API quota available
- [ ] PDF file is valid and < 32MB
- [ ] Browser console open to see logs
- [ ] Terminal visible to see server logs

## Still Having Issues?

Check these locations for error details:

1. **Browser Console** (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
   - Look for red errors
   - Check "Upload response" log

2. **Terminal** (where `npm run dev` is running)
   - Server-side errors appear here
   - Look for Prisma/database errors

3. **Network Tab** (F12 ‚Üí Network tab)
   - Check `/api/uploadthing` requests
   - Look at request/response data

If you see specific error messages, the code now provides detailed information about what went wrong and where.

## Next Steps After Fix

1. Test upload with a small PDF
2. Verify summary generation works
3. Check database entry created
4. Test downloading summary
5. Try with larger PDFs

**Note:** The code improvements are already in place. The main issue is likely missing environment variables. Once those are added and the server is restarted, uploads should work.
